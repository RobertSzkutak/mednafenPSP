|                               |
|-------------------------------|

Install EBOOT in :

ms0:/PSP/GAME/mednafenPSP/

Place ROMs in :

ms0:/PSP/GAME/mednafenPSP/roms

Place mednafen-09x.cfg from this repository in ms0:/PSP/GAME/mednafenPSP/

Note: Directories are case sensitive.

The control scheme for the emulator should be fairly obvious. Feel free to let me know if you have better ideas for it.
